Incremental bound -> property testing

A `superset` of these algorithms.
It is evident `its not so evident`. 
`engineering problems` -> problems arising in 

Beginning 
Start with real world situation and then use the hashcode problem as a particularly usefull situation 
(why is this work important, mention that before starting talking about the hashcode)

This is a real world situation.
These are the hashcode problems.
We Tipically use Meta-Heuristics to solve them.
Its a great oportunity to study them in these circumnstances and develop generic modelling approaches.
No one cares about modelling but I do. So I am going to prove that this is actually a relevant topic.
The community does not believe it but I shall be the profet.

Success Criteria
We are able to model problems using this framework
We solve the problems, get good results and see that this framework is usefull in the competition context
We are able to test meta-heuristics and see if one of these stands out in the croud. Across the range of problems

Objectives:
A. Model problems (using a principled approach)
B. Test Meta-Heuristics (develop algorithms under this approach)
C. Obtain quality results and investigate the advantages and disadvantages of the
   approach.

Contribuition:
A. Use the Hash Code problems and solve them in a principled manner
   - Contributing with good examples on `how to model` that go beyond the the classical benchmark problems.
   - Develop the modelling framework to better fit the users needs (side quest)
   - Develop the modelling framework to better integrate local search strategies (side quest) 
B. Develop Meta-Heuristic solvers and small utilities
   - Contribute with example algorithms and solvers that show that it is (side quest)
     possible to develop solvers and models independently (abiding to the same
     framework)
   - 
C. Gather results that allow us to see if some algorithms are better than 
   others and if our approach is competitive in practice. (and in runtime)
