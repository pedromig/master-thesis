\begin{frame}{Conclusion}
  In this work we were able to:

  \begin{itemize}
    \item Implement a modeling framework for meta-heuristics.
    \item Implement several meta-heuristic solvers.
    \item Develop models two Google Hash Code problems that achieve competitive results.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Future Work}
  The following topics can be considered as interesting future work directions:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Development of more Google Hash Code problem models.
    \item Implementation of more Meta-Heuristic solvers.
    \item Experimental evaluation of Meta-Heuristics.
  \end{itemize}
