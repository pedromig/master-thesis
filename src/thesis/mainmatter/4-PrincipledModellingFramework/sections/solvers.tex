This section introduces a potential implementation of solvers using the proposed
framework. The aim is to provide an overview of how meta-heuristic algorithms
can be developed utilizing the methods provided by the model API. To accomplish
this, we will start by describing a basic solver that utilizes heuristic
information for constructing solutions. Subsequently, we will demonstrate how
solvers for both~\acrshort{constructive-search} and~\acrshort{local-search}
methods can be implemented, using~\acrshort{beam-search}
and~\acrshort{iterated-local-search} meta-heuristics as illustrative examples.

\subsection{Heuristic Construction}
\label{subsec:heuristic-construction}

\Cref{lst:hc} describes a possible implementation of a
~\acrshort{meta-heuristic} solver that iteratively constructs a solution using
only heuristic information. This solver takes as input a~\texttt{Problem}
instance and returns a~\texttt{Solution}.

\input{mainmatter/4-PrincipledModellingFramework/listings/hc.tex}

This solver can be summarized as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Initialization}: Initialize a new empty~\texttt{Solution}
        and select a~\texttt{Component} to be added heuristically.~(lines 2-3)
  \item \textbf{Construction}: Build the solution.~(lines 4-6)
        \begin{enumerate}
          \item If there is a component (\texttt{c}) available for addition to the
                current solution,~(\ie{},~\texttt{c} is not the~\texttt{None}
                sentinel value), proceed; otherwise stop.
          \item Add the selected component to the solution.
          \item Heuristically select a new component and repeat the process.
        \end{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Termination} Return the final~\texttt{Solution}.~(line 7)
\end{enumerate}

As it can be observed this solver is simple and can be also used for easily
testing the model, given its only dependence on two basic methods:
the~\texttt{add} method for adding a component to the solution and the
~\texttt{heuristic\_add\_move} for selecting the next component to be added.
