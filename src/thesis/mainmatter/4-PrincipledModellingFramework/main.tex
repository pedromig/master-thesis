In this chapter, we introduce a modeling framework designed to address the
challenges of Google Hash Code problems. This framework integrates existing
modeling concepts from the~\acrshort{pof},~\acrshort{nasf4nio}, and
\acrshort{nasf4nio-cs} projects. In~\Cref{sec:model-definition}, we establish
the model by defining a standard specification that supports the development of
meta-heuristics. Subsequently, in~\Cref{sec:meta-heuristic-dev}, we provide
examples illustrating how these operations can be utilized for crafting
meta-heuristics solvers. Moving forward, in~\Cref{sec:test-env}, we reflect on
how the model specification can aid in the testing process. Finally, we
conclude the chapter in~\Cref{sec:pmf-concluding-remarks}, where we offer
observation on the framework's usage within the context of this work.
