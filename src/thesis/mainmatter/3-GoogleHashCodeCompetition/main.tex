This chapter presents an overview of the Google Hash Code competition. In
~\Cref{sec:hashcode-format}, we provide a concise review of the competition,
encompassing both its historical background and format. Subsequently,
in~\Cref{sec:hashcode-problems}, we delve into the problems presented to
participants over the years, attempting to categorize them and establish
connections with well-known combinatorial optimization problems described in the
literature. Moving forward,~\Cref{sec:hashcode-instance} sheds light on the
design of competition instances. Concluding this
chapter,~\Cref{sec:hashcode-remarks} offers remarks that highlight key aspects
of the competition problems, deemed pertinent to this work.
