  \item[\textbf{C1.}] Building upon existing research on well-structured
    modeling for meta-heuristics~\cite{vieira2009uma,fonseca2021nasf4nio,outeiro2021application},
    this document aims to gather and formalize a comprehensive specification. Our
    goal is to bring together all the concepts and developments made so far. For
    this purpose, we've created a practical Python implementation of the
    framework, with the aim of summarizing the existing ideas related to modeling
    for both constructive and local search methods.

  \item[\textbf{C2.}] We implemented several meta-heuristic solvers and utilities
    both for gathering the solutions and for testing the developed models. Given
    that these are general-purpose they can work with any model that is developed
    under the practical implementation of the framework we devised.

  \item[\textbf{C3.}] We selected two Google Hash Code problems for which some
    models for each of the problems were developed that explore the different
    properties of the problems in an attempt to obtain the best solutions
    possible. Furthermore, these models provide a practical example on how to
    model relatively complex problems and also allows us to think critically
    about the framework capabilities.
