The remainder of thesis is structured as follows. In~\Cref{ch:background}, we
provide an overview of optimization concepts, meta-heuristics, and modelling in
the context of meta-heuristics. Moving to~\Cref{ch:hashcode-problems}, we
analyze the Google Hash Code competition, focusing on the characteristics of the
problems and their relation to existing~\acrshort{combinatorial-optimization}
literature.~In~\Cref{ch:principled-modelling-framework}, we discuss the modelling
framework and its role in meta-heuristic development.
\Cref{ch:optimize-data-center,ch:book-scanning} present detailed studies of the
Hash Code problems \textquote{Optimize a Data Center} and \textquote{Book
  Scanning}, and the experimental results obtained.  Finally,~\Cref{ch:conclusion}
summarizes findings in this work and suggest future research directions.
