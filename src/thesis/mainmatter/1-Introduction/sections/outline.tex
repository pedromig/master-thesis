The remainder of thesis is structured as follows. In~\Cref{ch:background}, we
provide an overview of optimization concepts, meta-heuristics, and modeling in
the context of meta-heuristics. Moving to~\Cref{ch:hashcode-problems}, we
analyze the Google Hash Code competition, focusing on problem characteristics
and their relation to existing~\acrshort{combinatorial-optimization} literature.
In~\Cref{ch:principled-modelling-framework}, we discuss a modeling framework and
its role in meta-heuristic development.
\Cref{ch:optimize-data-center,ch:book-scanning} present detailed
studies of the Hash Code problems \textquote{Optimize Data Center} and
\textquote{Book Scanning}, with experimental results.
Finally,~\Cref{ch:conclusion} summarizes findings and suggests future research
directions.
