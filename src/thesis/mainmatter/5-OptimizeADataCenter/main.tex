This chapter offers an in-depth analysis of
the~\textquote{\nameref{subsubsec:hashcode-2015-qualification}} problem of the
Google Hash Code 2015 qualification round.~Particularly,
in~\Cref{sec:odc-problem} we provide a formal description of the problem,
highlighting details that we considered essential for
modeling.~In~\Cref{sec:odc-model} we delve into the details of the model that
was developed for this problem.~In~\Cref{sec:odc-results} we present an overview
of the results obtained, comparing them to those achieved by other participants
during the competition.~Finally,~\Cref{sec:odc-concluding-remarks} offers some
concluding remarks on the entire process, regarding both the implementation and
problem modeling aspects.
