In this chapter, we delve into an extensive analysis of the problem presented in
the Google Hash Code 2020 qualification round,
titled~\textquote{\nameref{subsubsec:hashcode-2020-qualification}}. Similarly to
the previous chapter, our primary goal lies in describing the modeling process
for this particular problem. As such, in~\Cref{sec:bs-problem} we present a
description of the problem focusing on the details found most relevant.
In~\Cref{sec:bs-model} we describe the modeling strategy used for this
problem. In~\Cref{sec:bs-results} we highlight the main results that were
obtained in comparison to those achieved by participants during the
competition. Lastly,~\Cref{sec:bs-concluding-remarks} offers some remarks on
problem-solving process.
