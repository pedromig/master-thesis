In this chapter, we conducted a comprehensive exploration of the Google Hash
Code competition, delving into its structure, problem descriptions, and instance
generation. In particular, we established links between the challenges presented
and well-known~\acrshort{combinatorial-optimization} problems. Furthermore, we
highlighted common techniques employed by participants, drawing from our own
engagement in the competition.

We consider this analysis to be an important step that not only facilitated
a deeper comprehension of the challenges, but also guided our choice of two
specific problems (\nameref{subsubsec:hashcode-2015-qualification} and~\nameref{subsubsec:hashcode-2020-qualification}) for detailed
exploration in this study. Thus, in the ensuing chapters, we will discuss our
modeling approach, analyze the chosen problems, and reflect on the conclusions
drawn from the work.
