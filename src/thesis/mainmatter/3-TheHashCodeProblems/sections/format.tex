% The Hash Code competition problems are modeled on complex engineering challenges
% faced by Google. Given the scale of the enterprise, it is evident that they
% represent complex engineering challenges that mirror real-world scenarios
% prevalent in the industry. As such, these problems not only function as valuable
% benchmark problems, but also provide an opportunity to establish a robust
% baseline for the development and testing of modeling based meta-heuristic
% approaches. This is because numerous individuals with diverse backgrounds have
% attempted to solve these problems, resulting in readily accessible scores and
% solutions.

% When examining the available information about the solutions for the problems,
% it is essential to take into consideration a few key points. Firstly, since only
% a select number of teams from the qualification round advance to the finals, the
% number of solutions available tend to be limited. However, it is reasonable to
% expect that the solutions found by the top teams will be excellent
% representatives of the best problem-solving processes, as they have undergone
% the selection process. Secondly, in the early years of the competition, it was
% only open to teams from Paris. In the subsequent three years, it was open to
% teams from Europe, Africa, and the Middle East before becoming a worldwide
% competition. Therefore, it is expected that there will be an increase in the
% number of results available in the later years and more challenging problems due
% to the increase in competition.

% In order to fulfill the objectives of this work, it is crucial to gain a
% thorough understanding of the problem at hand before proceeding with the
% formulation of the model. This includes identifying the objective, classifying
% the problem type, understanding the constraints, and most importantly,
% determining its relationship to problems previously studied in literature.
% Through this analysis, valuable insights into the appropriate approach can be
% gained. Therefore, a comprehensive analysis of the Hash Code problems was
% conducted and a summary of the key aspects of each problem evaluated in this
% first semester is presented in the following sections
